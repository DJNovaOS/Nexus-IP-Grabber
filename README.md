# Nexus-IP-Grabber

Nexus is a line of Hacking and testing tools that can be used to test users as well as systems. All these tools are for learning only not for use to harm others.

This new add-on is a simple local web server that is ported using ngrok, you can add additional link shorteners to be able to hide the link better. It's as simple as sending this link to a user and having them click it, this will log their IP in the console. Right now the system does not check for VPNs and or spoofed IP this is the basic script. It may or may not be updated.

# How to use
